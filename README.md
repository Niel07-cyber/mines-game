# Mines Game

A simple Minesweeper-inspired game built with Python and Tkinter. Avoid the mines and earn money by clicking safe boxes!

## How It Works
1. Select a difficulty level.
2. Click on boxes to reveal safe spots or mines.
3. Earn $5 for each safe box clicked.
4. The game ends if you hit a mine or win by uncovering all safe boxes.
